Comparing the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the Command-Line Interface (CLI) reveals several key differences:

 GUIs are generally easier to use, especially for beginners, as they rely on visual elements like windows, icons, and menus.
CLIs, require users to use text commands, which can be difficult for those that dont know or understand the commands.
CLIs use less memory are faster because they donâ€™t need to load graphical elements. 
GUIs, more user-friendly, need more memory and processing power. GUIs allow for easier multitasking by allowing users to open several windows and applications at the same time.
CLIs can also multitask, but it's more complicated to manage
In summary, GUIs are more user-friendly, CLIs provide greater control and efficiency.
